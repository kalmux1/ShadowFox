Create two dictionaries, one for your expenses and one for your partner's expenses.

"Hotel": 1200,
"Food": 800,
"Transportation": 500,
"Attractions": 300,
"Miscellaneous": 200
}
Your partner's expenses
partner_expenses = {
"Hotel": 1000,
"Food": 900,
"Transportation": 600,
"Attractions": 400,
"Miscellaneous": 150
}
Calculate the total expenses for each of you and print the results.
